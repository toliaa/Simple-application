# Simple Application

This repository contains a simple application with a main Windows Forms form called MyForm. It performs various tasks based on user input. Below are brief descriptions of each functionality along with instructions on how to use them.

## 1. Computing the value of the expression

This feature computes the value of a mathematical expression based on a provided formula. It takes input from the user for the value of `x` and then calculates the expression. The result is displayed to the user.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the value of `x` when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the expression and display the result.

## 2. Finding the sum of the terms of an arithmetic progression

This functionality calculates the sum of the terms of an arithmetic progression. The user inputs the first term, common difference, and the number of terms in the progression. The program then computes the sum and presents it to the user.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the first term, common difference, and the number of terms when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the sum of the terms and display the result.

## 3. Determining whether a triangle is equilateral

This feature determines whether a triangle is equilateral or not. The user inputs the lengths of the triangle's sides, and the program checks if all sides are equal. It outputs either true or false based on the condition.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the lengths of the triangle's sides when prompted.
3. The program will determine if the triangle is equilateral and display the result.

## 4. Determining access level based on a password

This functionality manages access to a database based on a provided password. The user inputs a password, and the program checks it against specified conditions. Depending on the password, it determines the access level to the database and provides appropriate output.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the password when prompted.
3. The program will determine the access level and display the result.

## 5. Printing all Pythagorean numbers less than a given N

This feature prints all Pythagorean numbers less than a given value `N`. The user inputs the value of `N`, and the program identifies and displays all Pythagorean numbers (triplets) that satisfy the condition.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the value of `N` when prompted.
3. The program will print all Pythagorean numbers less than `N`.

## 6. Finding the sum of terms of a sequence between the minimum and maximum values

This functionality calculates the sum of terms of a sequence between the minimum and maximum values. The user inputs the sequence, and the program determines the minimum and maximum values. It then computes the sum of terms between these values and presents the result.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the sequence when prompted.
3. The program will calculate the sum of terms between the minimum and maximum values and display the result.

## 7. Determining the number of characters before a colon in a given string

This feature determines the number of characters before a colon (:) in a given string. The user provides the input string, and the program counts the characters before the colon and displays the count.

### Usage
1. Run the program by launching the MyForm.h form.
2. Enter the string when prompted.
3. The program will count the characters before the colon and display the count.
